This is an alx-project which test our ability to work on a developing a website. this project is done by Daniel.

i will be working on a simple music recommender, getting recommendation on songs based on song inputed which is similar in factors like acousticness','danceability','duration_ms','energy','instrumentalness','liveness','loudness','speechiness','tempo','valence.

these factors will enable spotify do all the work and recommend songs through their api to be displayed on the website.
